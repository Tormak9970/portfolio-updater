Whether this be through using models for fan films, or creating tools for the community (such as my <i>Character and Outfit Designer</i>), the community enjoys finding new and unique was to utilize the game.","description":"I became a collaborator (essentially I work on new tools and techniques for the community, and help people whenever they have questions) because of my work on the <i>Character and Outfit Designer</i>. This was because I added a secondary feature to my tool, the ability to download a <i>.zip</i> file with all of the nessesary information to recreate the character in Blender. This, combined with a script I wrote to automatically  locates all the models and textures, takes a process that used to take over 1 hour, and makes it take under 20 minutes. Since finishing that, I continue to help people, as well as work to make the process even easier.","projects":[{"name":"Slicers GUI","linkId":"slicers-gui"},{"name":"TORC Character Designer","linkId":"torc-character-designer"},{"name":"Wiki","linkId":"slicers-wiki"},{"name":"Slicers Blender Importer","linkId":"slicers-blender-importer"}]}},"art":{"oArt":"","key":"","data":{"name":"","img":"","description":""}}}}
